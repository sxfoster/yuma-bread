  <p>The Cinnamon-Sugar Swirl Loaf starts with our soft dough enriched with butter and a hint of milk. We roll it out, sprinkle a generous layer of cinnamon and brown sugar, then roll it into a tight spiral. Baked each morning in our downtown Yuma kitchen, it fills the bakery with a sweet aroma. The loaf slices beautifully, revealing ribbons of spiced sugar. Enjoy it toasted with a smear of cream cheese or as the base for decadent French toast. Locals often serve it alongside afternoon coffee. Its delicate crumb and cinnamon warmth make every bite comforting. It's a favorite after-school snack for kids and adults alike. Treat yourself to a thick slice warmed in the oven.</p>
