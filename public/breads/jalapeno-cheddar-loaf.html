  <h1>Jalapeño &amp; Cheddar Loaf</h1>
  <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400" alt="Jalapeño &amp; Cheddar Loaf from Yuma Hearth Bakery">
  <p>Our Jalapeño &amp; Cheddar Loaf packs bright heat and a creamy bite. We fold diced jalapeños and sharp cheddar into the dough, then allow it to ferment overnight for maximum flavor. Baked in small batches each morning in downtown Yuma, the loaf emerges with a lightly blistered crust and pockets of melted cheese. It’s a fun choice for burgers or served beside a bowl of chili. Locals love using leftovers for spicy grilled cheese sandwiches. The combination of chewy interior and crisp edges makes this loaf a real crowd pleaser for any get-together. Try it toasted with a smear of cream cheese for a spicy breakfast. It pairs wonderfully with crisp ales from our local breweries.</p>
