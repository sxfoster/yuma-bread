  <p>Our Honey &amp; Oats Loaf combines wholesome rolled oats with a touch of local honey for a subtle sweetness. We soak the oats overnight, allowing them to soften before kneading them into the dough. Each morning in downtown Yuma, the loaf bakes to a nutty aroma and golden top. Its tender crumb offers a bit of chew while the oats add texture. This bread is delicious toasted and topped with your favorite jam, or used to elevate a turkey sandwich. Many customers choose it for breakfast, thanks to its hearty yet gentle flavor that reminds them of home. It's also wonderful with a drizzle of peanut butter or sliced bananas.</p>
