  <p>The Garlic &amp; Herb Loaf showcases roasted garlic cloves folded with a mix of garden herbs. We let the dough rest overnight to develop aroma and a soft interior. Each morning in downtown Yuma, loaves are shaped by hand and baked to a crisp crust. The flavor is earthy and fragrant, making it a favorite for dipping into olive oil or serving with pasta dishes. Locals enjoy it toasted with a smear of butter and a sprinkle of sea salt. Whether it's the centerpiece of a dinner or a simple side, this loaf brings comforting depth. It also pairs nicely with roasted chicken or grilled vegetables.</p>
