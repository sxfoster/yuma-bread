  <h1>Parmesan &amp; Black Pepper Loaf</h1>

  <p>The Parmesan &amp; Black Pepper Loaf starts with our soft sourdough base and gets a savory lift from finely grated Parmesan and cracked black pepper. We incorporate the cheese throughout the dough so every bite bursts with flavor. After a slow fermentation, loaves are baked until the crust turns a deep golden brown. The result is a fragrant bread that locals love with a bowl of tomato soup or sliced for grilled panini. It's crafted daily in downtown Yuma, right alongside our other small-batch breads. Try serving it with a drizzle of olive oil for an easy appetizer. Pairs beautifully with crisp white wines and fresh salads.</p>
